#Case Studies

1.Create an abstract class 'Bank' with an abstract method 'getBalance'.
  $100, $150 and $200 are deposited in banks A, B and C respectively.
  'BankA', 'BankB' and 'BankC' are subclasses of class 'Bank', each
  having a method named 'getBalance'. Call this method by creating an
  object of each of the three classes.

2.We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects
 (each out of 100) by student A and in four subjects (each out of 100) by
 student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with an abstract method
 'getPercentage'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B' each having
 a method with the same name which returns the percentage of the
 students. The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as
 its parameters and the marks in four subjects as its parameters for
 student B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the
 percentage of marks for both the students.
 
3.Create an abstract class 'Animals' with two abstract methods 'cats' and
 'dogs'. Now create a class 'Cats' with a method 'cats' which prints
 "Cats meow" and a class 'Dogs' with a method 'dogs' which prints
 "Dogs bark", both inheriting the class 'Animals'. Now create an object
 for each of the subclasses and call their respective methods. 
 
4.We have to calculate the area of a rectangle, a square and a circle. Create an
 abstract class 'Shape' with three abstract methods namely 'RectangleArea'
 taking two parameters, 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' taking one parameter
 each. The parameters of 'RectangleArea' are its length and breadth, that of
 'SquareArea' is its side and that of 'CircleArea' is its radius. Now create
 another class 'Area' containing all the three methods 'RectangleArea',
 'SquareArea' and 'CircleArea' for printing the area of rectangle, square and
 circle respectively. Create an object of class 'Area' and call all the three
 methods.
 Repeat the above question for 4 rectangles, 4 squares and 5 circles. Hint- Use
 array of objects.
 
5.Create a class called Employee that includes three pieces of information as
 instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String)
 and a monthly salary (double). Your class should have a constructor that
 initializes the three instance variables. Provide a set and a get method for
 each instance variable. If the monthly salary is not positive, set it to 0.
 Write a test application named Employee_Test that demonstrates class
 Employee’s capabilities. Create two Employee objects and display each
 object’s yearly salary. Then give each Employee a 10% raise and display
 each Employee’s yearly salary again.
